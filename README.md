SuperWE
================================================================
An [OpenWE](https://github.com/Sicraftails/SMM-WE-OpenWE) fork
containing many changes and new content.

This fork has some refactors (such as how string localizing works)
and adds new features (such as the star coin and the _World Maker,
coming soon....._)

Currently, there are no builds available as SuperWE is in early
alpha.

Obtaining SuperWE
----------------------------------------------------------------
Here's what you'll need first:

-  GameMaker Studio 2.3 or newer;
-  Git. (optional)

And here are the steps:

1. Download the main branch from the `Code` button in the top right
   or clone it via the terminal, as usual:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NCubss/SuperWE.git
   ```
2. Open the YYP file or import it via GameMaker Studio.
3. Enjoy! Modify the code to your heart's content.

Note
----------------------------------------------------------------
As SuperWE is still in early alpha, don't expect the code to look
fantastic. I am trying my best to improve it!
